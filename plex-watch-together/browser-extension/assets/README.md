# Placeholder Icons

The extension needs these icon files:
- icon-16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon-32.png (32x32 pixels)  
- icon-48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon-128.png (128x128 pixels)

For now, the extension will work without icons, but Chrome may show warnings.

To create proper icons:
1. Design a 128x128 icon with the theme of watching together (ðŸŽ¬ðŸ‘¥)
2. Use image editing software to create smaller versions
3. Save as PNG files with transparency

Suggested design elements:
- Plex orange/yellow color (#e5a00d)
- Video/film icon
- People/group icon
- Modern, flat design style
